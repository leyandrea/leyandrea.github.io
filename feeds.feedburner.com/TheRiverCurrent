				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The web is an ever-evolving medium propelled forward by enthusiastic developers and creators. Animation is just a slice of web design that has risen to high acclamation in recent years. The methods and techniques for adding motion to an interface may have changed, but the end result is still a lively design with charming interactive tendencies.</p>
<p>The following <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/category/trends/" target="_blank">trends</a> are a catalog of the current era in website animation. While JavaScript is a fantastic animation language, CSS has become easier and heavily supported by the design community. By embracing these newer CSS techniques you&#8217;ll stumble down avenues of unique animation and exciting design trends for years to come.</p>
<h2><b>Homepage Animation</b></h2>
<p>Aesthetic appeal in web design can be generated through various means. And while everyone can appreciate beauty, the self-proclaimed aesthetes will surely notice the power of beautiful animation.</p>
<p>A website&#8217;s homepage can be improved through branding, icons, illustrations, or any number of added features. Once the underlying user experience has been created, it&#8217;s easier to focus on a layer of colorful graphics and spicy design techniques. Animation is one such technique that can really spice up a homepage to draw attention from new visitors.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://underbelly.is/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/01-underbelly-website-blue-bg-agency.jpg" alt="underbelly design agency website animated" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Underbelly has a brief animation in their header that represents the agency&#8217;s talents.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://underbelly.is/">Underbelly</a> is a creative agency with a very clean website. I love their design because it&#8217;s straightforward and true to the company&#8217;s branding. Their homepage includes a brief animation in the header with a few icons representing the agency&#8217;s talents.</p>
<p>The great thing about this effect is how it draws attention. The animated elements are subtle but noticeable. First-time visitors can get a feel for the agency just from the initial website header. Although it is a simple example, it works perfectly in the context of Underbelly&#8217;s website.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://madebytheory.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/02-made-by-theory-website-homepage-header.jpg" alt="made by theory header animation" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Theory uses animation with offscreen slide/fade-in.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To see a more detailed homepage animation take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://madebytheory.com/">Theory agency website</a>. Their heading also uses animation on various elements that slide/fade in from offscreen. Right after landing on the homepage it should become apparent that Theory has talent.</p>
<p>When scrolling down the page other elements will animate into view. This effect is typically referred to as &#8220;scroll-to-animate&#8221;, for lack of a better term. Both effects, when combined, illustrate a fascinating combo for homepage animation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting effect that only requires a tiny bit of JavaScript. I feel it works best on product pages where screenshots and previews are of vital importance. But there&#8217;s no question that elegantly animated elements on the homepage will draw attention while painting a picture of the website&#8217;s true purpose.</p>
<h2><b>Content Galleries &#038; Slideshows</b></h2>
<p>Interactive page elements can also utilize animation for a snappy response to user input. Mobile touchscreen apps were the first to pioneer the concept of immediate response based on the user&#8217;s action.</p>
<p>For example <a target="_blank" href="http://marketblog.envato.com/trends/introduction-material-design/">Google&#8217;s Material Design</a> &amp; Apple&#8217;s iOS both support multiple animation styles. Users can swipe, tap, touch &amp; hold, pull down, pinch &amp; zoom, among other alternatives. These interactions will create different animations based on the operating system&#8217;s UX guidelines.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/mac/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/04-apple-mac-slider-content-widget.jpg" alt="apple mac slider animated" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Product slider featuring all of the various Mac products.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">Apple Mac website</a> near the top of the page. It has a product slider featuring all of the various Mac products. On first pageload each item will animate and fade into the slider. Then as you click between different categories the items will animate in from the side.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this effect is motion applied to each item. When moving to the right new items will animate in like the slider panned over to the right. When moving back it&#8217;ll actually feel like the slider is panning back like a video camera. This elastic animation makes the website feel more &#8220;alive&#8221; as if it behaves according to the natural laws of gravity and motion.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://geomanist.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/05-geomanist-typography-content-slider.jpg" alt="geomanist content slider" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">the fullscreen slider from Geomanist.</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can see a fullscreen slider example on the <a target="_blank" href="http://geomanist.com/">Geomanist homepage</a>. There isn&#8217;t an elastic effect but the content does animate as expected in a carousel rotation.</p>
<p>When adding a content gallery to your site try to include animation or CSS transitions. Most <a href="http://codecanyon.net/category/css" target="_blank">plugins</a> come with the option to setup animated effects without a lot of extra code. This is a small effect, but it can go a long way towards giving the illusion of vitality in a webpage.</p>
<h2><b>Form Input Fields</b></h2>
<p>Another interactive element is the ever-popular web form. Most forms are comprised of various elements like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, select menus, and other thingamabobs.</p>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/inspirations/subtly-animated-forms/">Animated forms</a> behave just like content sliders &#8211; they give a sense of life to user interactivity. Users enjoy seeing a response from their click, scroll, or keypress event. The default browser response is often fine, but adding that little extra oomph to your form can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Take a look at the below <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/dylanraga/full/Qwqbab/">CodePen snippet</a> which creates animated checkbox inputs. The whole thing is built using pure CSS3 transition effects.</p>
<p data-height="438" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="Qwqbab" data-default-tab="result" data-user="dylanraga" class='codepen'>
<p><script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<p>Although the animation would only be supported in modern browsers it adds a beautiful effect without a whole lot of extra code. It may seem insignificant to webmasters, but users often love these added features. Little animations demonstrate careful attention to detail, and it&#8217;s often the little things that color our opinion of a website.</p>
<p data-height="421" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ohLIa" data-default-tab="result" data-user="MichaelArestad" class='codepen'>
<p><script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<p>Another great use of form animation is with input labels. This trend is still fairly new but it is a profound method of capturing attention. The premise behind this animation is to save space in a text field when needed.</p>
<p>Note that the above <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/MichaelArestad/full/ohLIa">CodePen animated inputs snippet</a> is also built using pure CSS. Although many frontend developers like to play with CSS animation there&#8217;s nothing wrong with adding a JavaScript alternative. This is actually much safer considering not everyone is using a CSS3-supported browser.</p>
<p>Overall forms are a great place to add animation. They&#8217;re interactive by default so users often appreciate the animated response(s) to their interactivity.</p>
<h2><b>Sliding Navigation</b></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a big juicy <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/trends/taking-look-current-responsive-navigation-trends/">hodgepodge of navigation styles</a> to choose from &#8211; and unsurprisingly most of them can be animated. Many designers think of the hamburger sliding menus like you&#8217;d find on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cc.com/">Comedy Central</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supereightstudio.com/">Supereight</a> websites. But this is perhaps the obvious answer to sliding navigation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://humaan.com/about/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/08-humaan-website-sliding-topbar-navigation.jpg" alt="humaan slider topbar animation" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Scroll past the header and the nav-bar will animate into view.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Consider the more abstract uses of animation like fixed sliding navbars. These often appear as if they&#8217;re static at the top of the page until the visitor starts scrolling. The nav will attach itself to the very top of the website and stay with the visitor throughout their excursion.</p>
<p>The layout for <a target="_blank" href="http://humaan.com/about/">Humaan</a> is a great example. As you scroll down past the header the navigation bar will animate into view. It slides down right off-screen and stays fixed until reaching the very top of the page. Although the sliding motion isn&#8217;t necessary, it does add some excitement to the design.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cabedge.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/09-cabedge-website-dropdown-animated-navigation.jpg" alt="cabedge dropdown animation menu" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The lifelike navigation from Cabedge.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another distinct example can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cabedge.com/">Cabedge</a> website. The navigation consists of a horizontal banner with a few links nested alongside the company&#8217;s logo.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite dropdown animations because it feels so lifelike. There&#8217;s a brief delay before the sub-menu drops and the colors make the whole navigation feel like one big ribbon. The devil is truly in the details where one little decision can either make or break a wonderful animation effect.</p>
<h2><b>Expansive Page Motion</b></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult and high-risk style of web animation is a layout based on many various animated elements. There is no official name for this technique but the idea follows that a designer would create lots of different animations for the pageload, along with user interactions like mouse hovers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s risky because this can slow down a great website to a crawl with too much JavaScript. Running too many animations in sequence can be disastrous &#8211; but placing them in sync with a natural rhythm can make one of the most dynamic interfaces on the web.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.alectia.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10-alectia-dark-website-homepage-animation.jpg" alt="alectia fully animated website" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ALECTIA has a website primarily run via JavaScript.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The large services company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alectia.com/en/">ALECTIA</a> has a website primarily run via JavaScript. There are still full URLs to each page, however the page transitions load via Ajax. This means you can visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alectia.com/en/services">services page directly</a> but it can also be loaded dynamically from the navigation.</p>
<p>If you spend enough time browsing this site you&#8217;ll conclude that almost every element has some form of animation. While the animation techniques are incredibly impressive, what&#8217;s really interesting is how the website runs flawlessly. I experienced no lag time, no browser crash, and no visual bugs while navigating the site.</p>
<p>ALECTIA is the pristine example of all-over animation. This is <strong>not</strong> an easy effect to pull off and certainly not good for every project. But when done properly a fully-animated website can become a hybrid web application and truly stand out as a game changer.</p>
<h2><b>SVG Animation</b></h2>
<p>One of the newer standards into the field of web animation is <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/learn-something-new/getting-started-inline-svg/">SVG</a>. These are vector-based graphics which can be rendered, resized, and scaled naturally without any quality loss. Adobe Illustrator is the most popular program for creating SVGs but there are <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/resources/tools-boost-your-svg-workflow/">other alternatives</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://bjango.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/11-bjango-svg-css-animation-hover.jpg" alt="bjango svg animation navigation" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Bjango header has been created using two SVG images.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The header design found on <a target="_blank" href="http://bjango.com/">Bjango</a> is absolutely superb. Each navigation link is created using two SVG images &#8211; the default text and the colorful hover text.</p>
<p>All of the animation effects are created using CSS3 keyframes which animate the text larger and smaller in a &#8220;bouncy&#8221; motion. The keyframes use <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform"><code>transform:scale()</code></a> to first increase then decrease the size of the image.</p>
<p>Since the text is an SVG it can be rendered and scaled quickly. Bjango has one of the simplest SVG animations because the animation is controlled via CSS and not the SVG. And while this effect is simply adorable keep in mind that older versions of IE 6-8 <a target="_blank" href="http://caniuse.com/svg">do not support SVG</a>.</p>
<p>But as for modern web browsers SVG is fully supported and only gaining momentum. Since these graphics don&#8217;t rely solely on pixels they can be scaled, stretched, and definitely animated in a smooth manner. To learn more check out some <a target="_blank" href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/01/07/shape-hover-effect-with-svg/">SVG animation tutorials</a> and see what you can build.</p>
<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p>All of these trends have come together through an advancement of frontend technologies and browser standards. CSS animation is a powerful feature that has recently been gaining serious traction. I hope these trends can offer a picturesque look into the modern state of web design and the potential future of CSS web animation.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, most web developers clearly understand the need to optimize a website for use on mobile devices. Usually this includes the implementation of <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/" target="_blank">responsive CSS</a> to create a great browsing experience for users of every screen size.</p>
<p>However, there are times when changing the layout is not enough. What if you need to go about changing the actual content of a page to work better for mobile visitors?</p>
<h2><b>An Example Use</b></h2>
<p>Recently, I was faced with this very issue. I&#8217;d built a WordPress site for a client using an events registration plugin. Its calendar layout was fantastic on larger screens, but completely unusable on smaller ones. While it seemed easy enough to change some CSS around to make it more mobile-friendly, this turned into quite an adventure.</p>
<p>After my attempts at reworking the CSS failed, I decided that it might be more efficient to simply list the upcoming events for mobile users rather than keeping the calendar format. But how?</p>
<h2><b>Mobile Detect to the Rescue</b></h2>
<p>A little research turned up <a href="http://mobiledetect.net/" target="_blank">Mobile Detect</a>, a PHP class that helps detect mobile devices. It uses user-agent strings and looks for specific HTTP headers in order to determine if a user is visiting from a mobile device. Then, using a simple PHP conditional statement, Mobile Detect will allow you to serve up separate content for mobile users.</p>
<p class="alert alert--inverse">&#8220;<em>Every business should have a mobile detection script to detect mobile readers.</em>&#8221; &#8211; <strong>The Mobile Detect motto</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really a quite simple process. Just upload the Mobile Detect files to your server and place code similar to this in your template:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?php 
&#47;&#47; Mobile Detect Script
define(&#39;__ROOT__&#39;, dirname(dirname(__FILE__)));
require_once(__ROOT__.&#39;&#47;your-path-to&#47;Mobile_Detect.php&#39;); 
$detect = new Mobile_Detect;
?&gt;

&lt;?php 
&#47;&#47; If this is a phone (tablets excluded) display mobile-specific content.
if( $detect-&gt;isMobile() &#038;&#038; !$detect-&gt;isTablet() ) { ?&gt;

Mobile Content Goes Here...

&lt;?php
&#47;&#47; Non-mobile devices will get the default content.
} else { ?&gt;

Default Content Goes Here...

&lt;?php } 
&#47;&#47; End of the Mobile Detect conditional.
?&gt;</pre>
<p>The result is that on both computers and tablets, the default content displays. On phones, the mobile-specific content is displayed instead. This allowed me to bypass the not-so-user-friendly calendar layout completely on small screens.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 660px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mobile-detect-1-660x235.png" alt="Desktop users see a calendar (left), while mobile users see a simple listing of events (right)." width="660" height="235" class="size-large wp-image-39064" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Desktop users see a calendar (left), while mobile users see a simple listing of events (right).</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>Concluding</b></h2>
<p>If you decide to use Mobile Detect, be aware that you actually have to view your site on a mobile device in order to see that custom content. A web designer&#8217;s first instinct is often to resize their desktop browser to do a quick check of how their responsive code is working (plus, it&#8217;s fun). That won&#8217;t work with Mobile Detect since it needs to see that a visitor is using a mobile user-agent.</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t be alarmed if you don&#8217;t see the content on your desktop or laptop. Pulling up the site on a phone will do the trick.</p>
<p>Overall, I found Mobile Detect very easy to implement and it provided much-needed functionality to my project. It will make a great addition to your toolbox.</p>
<p class="alert alert--blue">I should also note that there are <a href="https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect#3rd-party-modules--submit-new" target="_blank">3rd party plugins</a> that use Mobile Detect for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mobile-detect/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://www.yagendoo.com/en/blog/free-mobile-detection-plugin-for-joomla.html" target="_blank">Joomla!</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/mobile_detect" target="_blank">Drupal</a> and other platforms as well.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much in the same way clothes make the man, clean typography makes great content. Readable content is a huge part of every website. But one important pillar of readable content is quality design.</p>
<p>This post will take a look at <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/category/trends/">modern design trends</a> for common web typography. Design might include basics like font size and font family, all the way through more complex ideas like vertical spacing and line height. Typography design is best understood by analyzing other prominent websites to figure out why their text reads so well on the digital screen.</p>
<h2><b>Clean &#038; Styled Navigation</b></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/resources/responsive-navigation-solutions-resources/">Every navigation</a> will be styled differently based on each website&#8217;s layout. But when it comes to typography some general rules can be applied. For example, clean symmetrical typography can be used to identify similar navigation links as one group.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://punkave.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/01-punk-ave-website-homepage-nav-typography.jpg" alt="punk ave website homepage typography design" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">P&#8217;unk Avenue is a great demonstration of large usable navigation.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://punkave.com/">P&#8217;unk Avenue</a> is a great demonstration of large usable navigation. Each link follows a similar design format with a decimal, all-caps link text, and a bit of subtext. Their design may be a little showy but it&#8217;s a fantastic example of how to use symmetrical design to your advantage.</p>
<p>Another fantastic design can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.servemanager.com/">ServeManager.com</a>. They use plenty of space between each link, along with oversized typography which really stands out against the header. Contrast is bright so it&#8217;s very clear these links are primary navigation items.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.servemanager.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02-serve-manager-dark-blue-navigation.jpg" alt="serve manager dark website layout inspiration" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ServeManager use plenty of space between each link.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Usable nav links are created through some contrast and juxtaposition. If your navigation blends into the header then it&#8217;ll be more difficult to notice. At a glance it should be blatantly obvious how to navigate through your website. One reliable strategy is to use a larger font with a clean text style that stands out against the background.</p>
<h2><b>Distinguished Heading Text</b></h2>
<p>Page headings can serve different purposes in different circumstances. Typography defines how loud each heading should be, and how much attention will be drawn from the visitor.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://andrewelsass.com/about/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/03-andrew-elsass-portfolio-header.jpg" alt="andrew elsass portfolio about header" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The about page from Andrew Elsass uses a large heading with a fullscreen background.</figcaption></figure>
<p>One great example is the portfolio of <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewelsass.com/about/">Andrew Elsass</a>. His about page uses a large heading with a fullscreen background to draw instant attention. The page content itself is separated by other headings which are less noticeable but still serve their job well.</p>
<p>Static-content websites have many pages just like this where a main heading sits above other sub-headings. You can make the page headings stand out by using bright colors, icons, backgrounds, borders, or even unique font families. Other sites may prefer to just enlarge the regular page text for a more traditional style.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/reviews/gadgets/2015-02/new-nintendo-3ds-final-verdict"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/04-wired-co-uk-article-header-typography.jpg" alt="wired co uk magazine typography" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Wired article heading is large enough to stand out as a headline.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This technique can be found in many online magazines like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/reviews/gadgets/2015-02/new-nintendo-3ds-final-verdict">Wired</a>. The article heading is large enough to stand out as a headline, but not large enough to take up enormous space on the page.</p>
<p>Headings are meant to denote a break in content. Most designers create styles for h1-h4 tags because it&#8217;s unlikely that any website would delve below a fourth sub-heading. Each heading&#8217;s style should reflect the level of authority if holds over the entire page. Readers should be able to ascertain which topics are included inside other headers based on design alone.</p>
<p>Font size is the most common design property to communicate hierarchy. But you might consider testing other ideas like bold &#038; thin font weights or even adjusted letter spacing.</p>
<h2><b>Readable Paragraph Text</b></h2>
<p>Every website that includes some content will use paragraphs. Whether they&#8217;re only 1-sentence long or written as blocks of text that span the entire page &#8211; paragraphs are important. But honestly please don&#8217;t write illegible blocks of text because even the Devil himself will cringe.</p>
<p>Formatting is crucial to well-structured paragraphs. But formatting is generated by the style, spacing, and position of typography. For example it&#8217;s generally wise to err on the side of larger text rather than smaller. Likewise it&#8217;s a good idea to increase paragraph line heights instead of keeping every line tucked close together.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@Paperfold/10-things-startups-can-learn-from-origami-3d3741b18c29"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/05-startup-medium-article-paragraph-typography.jpg" alt="big typography paragraphs medium website design" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The typography from Medium is great for any screen size</a>txt.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/">Medium.com</a> is a new blogging platform that uses a similar design style for each blog. Their typography is great for any screen size because it offers enough space between lines and between paragraphs. Users generally won&#8217;t mind scrolling a bit more if it means they can read your content easier from a distance.</p>
<p>Anywhere from 2x-5x the line height between each paragraph is a sturdy margin number. A safe bottom margin on medium-sized paragraph text would be 15px-20px. If you want to have space that naturally resizes go for a value in ems.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://magazine.good.is/articles/bill-gates-stephen-hawking-elon-musk-artificial-intelligence"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/06-good-magazine-paragraphs-text-design.jpg" alt="good magazine typography text" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Serif fonts won&#8217;t present a problem, so long as they&#8217;re sized properly.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to the font choice many designers feel that sans-serif fonts are easier to read on the web. Serif fonts won&#8217;t present a problem, so long as they&#8217;re sized properly. Paragraph font choice really depends on the type of website.</p>
<p>A lot of online magazines and news blogs will stick to serif fonts as a means of duplicating the style of real-world newspapers. But the vast majority of websites from companies to portfolios and forums will use sans-serif. Just find whatever font works best for each project.</p>
<h2><b>Action-Oriented Hyperlinks</b></h2>
<p>Hyperlinks are one of the few areas in page text which are interactive. Most of the time visitors are reading through your page in a passive state. But hyperlinks require activity(a click) for visitors to access the external URL.</p>
<p>As such you&#8217;ll want to design hyperlinks so that they appear &#8220;clickable&#8221;. Great link design is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/13/the-definitive-guide-to-styling-web-links/">a lengthy subject</a> but generally explains the difference between static &#038; interactive content. The link hover state should also be noticeable whenever a visitor hovers their mouse over a hyperlink.</p>
<p>Great UX design should inherently convey that text is clickable without any interaction. This is traditionally accomplished using underlines and alternative text colors &#8211; but you can get a little obscure with background colors or varied letter spacing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.danparis.fr/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/07-dan-paris-agency-website-design.jpg" alt="dan paris agency website layout" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Links found in the DAN Paris menu have a dynamic underline effect on hover.</figcaption></figure>
<p>One example which may be seen as <em>avant-garde</em> is the agency website for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.danparis.fr/">DAN Paris</a>. The links found in their top navigation menu have a dynamic underline effect on hover. You&#8217;ll notice that a quick underline flashes across the link from left to right. This is certainly a more convoluted example but it captures attention.</p>
<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="lrFKj" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rupertone" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/rupertone/pen/lrFKj/'>Hover effect anchor tags</a> by Eugenio (<a href='http://codepen.io/rupertone'>@rupertone</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<p>Perhaps a more straightforward example is <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/rupertone/pen/lrFKj">this Codepen entry</a> (above) which utilizes CSS3 animation. The hover effect animates two curly brackets which extend onto either side of the link. It&#8217;s a unique effect that will no doubt draw attention from visitors.</p>
<p data-height="314" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ychAK" data-default-tab="result" data-user="kentliau" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/kentliau/pen/ychAK/'>Link Hover Effect #1</a> by Kent (<a href='http://codepen.io/kentliau'>@kentliau</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<p>If you need more link style ideas browse through some of the popular cloud IDEs like <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://cssdeck.com/">CSS Deck</a>. Some of the styles may use experimental or poorly-supported code, but they&#8217;ll surely evoke new ideas which you can redesign based on each project.</p>
<h2><b>Eccentric Blockquotes</b></h2>
<p>Not every article or webpage contains a blockquote. Yet when they are used it&#8217;s a good idea to convey that the text is clearly a quote or copy from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Many designers like to float blockquotes over to the side of paragraphs. These are known as <strong>pull quotes</strong> which may copy text from elsewhere in the article, or from a person mentioned in the article. Both of these text formats are very similar and should be distinguishable from regular page copy.</p>
<p>Take a look at the detailed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/stylish-blockquotes-pullquotes/">Hongkiat post on blockquotes</a>. It covers the gamut of fantastic design ideas from alternative colors to background quotation mark icons. But in many cases simplicity is victorious over excessive design.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7977963/fcc-net-neutrality-victory"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/10-the-verge-magazine-blockquote-typography.jpg" alt="the verge magazine pullquote design" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This pull quote style uses more visible color which is enlarged and italicized.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The example above is from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7977963/fcc-net-neutrality-victory">The Verge</a> which is an online media magazine. Their pull quote style simply uses more visible color which is enlarged and italicized. There&#8217;s no distinction between content other than some padding. And in this scenario it works perfectly.</p>
<p>When designing an inner-page text style whether it&#8217;s a blockquote or code snippet, aim for clarity through design. Let readers know that the block of text is not a paragraph by adjusting font properties wildly against the website&#8217;s traditional style. This is often a great reason to incorporate a second font family so that these blocks will clearly stand out.</p>
<h2><b>Styling Oversized Typography</b></h2>
<p>The trend of oversized text has grown into a modern design phenomenon. All sorts of layouts from parallax landing pages to corporate designs are using oversized typography.</p>
<p>With the release of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Web Fonts</a> it has become easier to incorporate various custom fonts into a webpage. And with faster Internet speeds there is little downside to including multiple fonts in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Big typography is attractive because it can be read much easier. More websites are becoming responsive and more people are visiting websites on their smartphones. These tiny screens can average 2-3 inches wide so it&#8217;s nice to support mobile visitors with clearly-legible page text.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39064" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a target="_blank" href="http://illusion.scene360.com/"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/11-illusion-magazine-large-typography-design.jpg" alt="illusion magazine large typography web design" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Illusion Magazine layout focuses more on composition, symmetry, and balance.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Check out the text-heavy design for <a target="_blank" href="http://illusion.scene360.com/">Illusion Magazine</a>. The layout focuses more on composition, symmetry, and balance between content areas. This is another good example of when oversized typography works best.</p>
<p>Websites that predominantly focus on text will benefit from increased font sizes. Larger page elements will naturally draw attention, so if page copy is an important design feature it&#8217;s a good idea to increase the font size to fill out more space.</p>
<p>This methodology is by no means a requirement, but it&#8217;s helpful to keep in mind when designing typography for text-heavy websites.</p>
<h2><b>Closing</b></h2>
<p>Designing a website from scratch is no easy task. The process includes a lot of abstract ideas like theme, style, and composition. But typography is a much more tangible subject that has more tangible solutions.</p>
<p>Hopefully these <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/category/trends/">trends</a> can be put to good use by designers who are looking to improve their website interfaces. Although solid page content is very important, the aesthetic design of text is often what persuades visitors to continue reading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cloudrise is a stunning and gripping short animated movie set in a fantasy, almost steampunk world high above the clouds. The main characters are Miko and Tenku, two lovers that have to fight to survive as their airship, after an attack from sky pirates, begins to plunge dangerously from the sky.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119430601?color=d79ce6&#038;title=0&#038;byline=0&#038;portrait=0&#038;badge=0" width="660" height="371" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The eight-minute minute short movie was created in only four months by Denver Jackson, a director with no previous animation or illustration experience. He just wanted to tell a &#8216;great story&#8217;. And a great story it is!</p>

<p><a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Surjithctly">Surjithctly</a> really caught our eye this month with the release of his awesome Chrome Extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-envato/mlbkjbladkceacbifjpgimbkibhgbadf?hl=en">Better Envato</a>.</p>
<p>The extension, which offers useful utility for Envato Market authors, provides features such as desktop sales notifications, comment notifications, ability to display earnings in your own currency, and much more! In fact, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://3docean.net/forums/thread/the-wait-is-over-desktop-comment-notification-and-more-introducing-better-envato/163855">forum thread dedicated to feedback</a> and suggestions which surjithctly actively monitors, so swing-by and say &#8220;hi!&#8221; if you use or are planning to use the Better Envato Chrome extension!</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough, surjithctly also took some time in the past week or so to offer some great suggestions for new community badges to serve our entire community, and he has also been a very positive influence in our forums as a whole lately with helpful answers to fellow members. Very well done, surjithctly!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the ever-growing popularity of the internet more and more websites are cropping up. Be it small businesses, artists, creative agencies or even personal blogs, almost every other person on the planet has a website.</p>
<p>Rightfully so. After all, having a proper web presence has now become a necessity, rather than a luxury.</p>
<p>As such, many services have launched in recent years that allow users to quickly and easily build websites within minutes. Commonly termed as <strong>Do-It-Yourself </strong>(henceforth abbreviated as DIY) website builders, these tools or services offer a simple interface that enables even the most technologically illiterate users to put together a simple website or blog with minimum effort.</p>
<p>So, are these DIY website builders worth the effort and money? Well, I&#8217;m going to try to answer that question.</p>
<h4><b>DIY Website Builders: What and How?</b></h4>
<p>For the sake of avoiding controversy, I will refrain from naming any one particular DIY website builder. However, all said and done, nearly all website builders follow more or less the same mechanism.</p>
<figure id="attachment_38846" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://graphicriver.net/item/website-development-flat-illustration/6780200"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/6780200-water.jpg" alt="Image Source: Website Development Flat Illustration by Bloomua." width="590" height="590" class="size-full wp-image-38846" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image Source: <a href="http://graphicriver.net/item/website-development-flat-illustration/6780200">Website Development Flat Illustration</a> by Bloomua.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Simply put, these website builders offer a simplistic tool or interface to help you &#8220;put together&#8221; your website, not actually &#8220;build&#8221; it. There is a WYSIWYG editor, coupled with a drag and drop interface that allows you to build and publish pages without any rocket science involved. Therefore, you can easily put together a website with basic functionality, say a contact form, some social media widgets, text and image areas, as well as a slightly more complex entity, say a blog or a portfolio page.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, most DIY builders offer a set of ready-made templates, which you can either customize via the drag and drop interface, or tweak by means of basic CSS edits. In either case, your design options are limited by the amount of editing skills and freedom given to you by the concerned DIY website builder.</p>
<h4><b>Where Lies The Flaw?</b></h4>
<p>On the surface, DIY website builders seem to be a pretty neat solution for folks who need a simple web presence: possibly a small blog, or maybe just a one-pager website.</p>
<p>However, there is more to the story.</p>
<p>In general, web design and web development is a tricky ordeal. A website can never be &#8220;put together&#8221;; websites are not jigsaw puzzles but works of art and need to be curated and created.</p>
<figure id="attachment_38846" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://graphicriver.net/item/responsive-web-design/9341869"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/9341869.jpg" alt="Image Source: Responsive Web Design by Yapanda" class="size-full wp-image-38846" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image Source: <a href="http://graphicriver.net/item/responsive-web-design/9341869">Responsive Web Design</a> by Yapanda.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem with DIY website builders is that they offer solutions for people who do need seek a solution, but an easy way out of their problem. &#8220;My neighbor and his dog have got a website, I need one too. Let me quickly put it together with this tool for $9.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above logic is not what someone should have when seriously contemplating having a website of their own.</p>
<p>There is a reason why Content Management Systems rose in popularity. WordPress, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and all the others in their ranks attempt to help users &#8220;create&#8221; websites. Sure, you can have a simple blog using your DIY builder, but your blog will not achieve much anytime soon, unless it uses something at the level of <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/trends/current-state-ghost/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>As such, DIY website builders offer not solutions, but compromises. Rudimentary websites with negligible functionality tend to be the norm in this case.</p>
<h4><b>The &#8220;Ease of Use&#8221; Logic</b></h4>
<p>One argument that is often put forth in favor of DIY website builders is that such solutions and services offer ease of use and simplicity for the average user. To some extent, this might be true. After all, not everyone can deploy a website using <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/learn-something-new/introduction-concrete5/">concrete5</a> or <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/learn-something-new/introduction-joomla/">Joomla</a>, can they?</p>
<figure id="attachment_38846" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://graphicriver.net/item/web-and-html-programming-flat-illustration/6941112"><img src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/6941112.jpg" alt="Image Source: Responsive Web Design by Yapanda" class="size-full wp-image-38846" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image Source: <a href="http://graphicriver.net/item/web-and-html-programming-flat-illustration/6941112">Web and HTML Programming</a> by Bloomua.</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, once again, this logic is just one face of the story.</p>
<p>Take up the case of flat-file CMSs such as FlatPress.</p>
<p>What can you achieve with <a href="http://flatpress.org/home/">FlatPress</a>? A simple, ready-to-use blog that does not even require a database to connect to and as such, is easy on server resources and very simple to manage.</p>
<p>Can FlatPress do everything that WordPress can? No.</p>
<p>Does it need to? Nope.</p>
<p>However, by choosing even FlatPress over a DIY website builder, you ensure that you are not locking yourself down to a set of narrowly defined templates and rules and terms of a given service. This in itself is a benefit big enough to consider a nimble CMS over a funky DIY site builder.</p>
<h4><b>Appraisal</b></h4>
<p>So, are all DIY website builders evil and need to perish?</p>
<p>No, I do not think so.</p>
<p>My sole point is that the recent claim to fame of several DIY website builders that their offerings can simplify life and reduce the needs of the services of a proper designer or developer are mere myths. Anyone who is serious about their website will opt for a proper solution that can actually get the task done, instead of betting on a DIY builder that allows you to choose from 50+ generic templates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the basic functionality, be it social media widgets or guestbook or blog sections, that DIY website builders have to offer, can only serve up to a given point. Following that, you will promptly realize the merits and boons of extending a CMS via extensions, themes, or plugins.</p>
<p>Websites, be they blogs or corporate sites, are dynamic entities, and need room to grow. You do not put together a website and forget all about it. Instead, you need to regularly keep updating it, and keep curating it. As such, the mainstream CMS is a much better solution than a DIY website builder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">We had an <strong>amazing</strong> response to our <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/interviews/chance-interview-ryan-terry-lead-designer-disney/">call for questions</a> to pose to Disney Lead Designer, Ryan Terry! More than 170 people submitted over 250 questions, thank you so much to everyone who submitted questions!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve picked out our favorite questions and mixed in a few of our own, so stand by for the much anticipated interview with Ryan Terry!</p>
<h2><strong><b>Who is Ryan Terry <em>(in his own words)</em>?</b></strong></h2>
<p><b>The Short Version</b></p>
<p>I’m an artist with an affinity for silliness.  I enjoy a wide range of art forms from drawing, animating and coding.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-39576" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ryan-disney-660x495.jpg" alt="Ryan's dreams come true!" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<p><b>The Longer Version</b></p>
<p>I’m originally from Houston, TX and aspired to be an animator from an early age.  I drew, drew, drew all the way to college where I received my BFA from the Savannah College of Art and Design in Computer Art with an emphasis in Interactive Design.</p>
<p>Life led me in a direction towards web design and development and I played in that world for a decade working for small agencies and freelancing for 8 years.  I both designed and developed Flash websites for brands like Coca-cola, Wal-mart and Harry Potter, while later transitioning into the app market working on apps for Dreamworks, Sony Animation and Disney.</p>
<p>For the past year and a half I’ve had the privilege of working as a Lead Designer for Disney, launching the Imagicademy brand at the end of 2014.</p>
<p>Outside of work you can find me with my wonderful wife and new baby daughter in Los Angeles.  I love drawing silliness, watching movies, riding my bike and working on my hobby projects.</p>

<h2><strong><b>What was your childhood dream?</b></strong></h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-39440" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/avatar92-1.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" />  <em>Question submitted by <strong>MetroThemes</strong></em></p>
<p>I absolutely, positively wanted to be a Disney Animator, making feature films.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-39555" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bo_1-660x854.jpg" alt="Image courtesy of Ryan Terry" width="660" height="854" /></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>Did something specific inspire you to take an artistic path, or was it something that you had always wanted to do?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39520" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Tier</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to take the artistic path.  What sparked my dream to be a Disney Animator was seeing <i>The Little Mermaid</i> for the first time.  It blew me away and I was hooked… pun intended.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>You’re proficient in many, (if not all!) areas of design, illustration, coding/development, and animation. How did you decide which element to focus on in your career?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar-01.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39521 size-full" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar-01.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>bogz</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the thing…I didn’t! I always thought I would be an animator, but I also love illustration. In college, I double-majored in 2D Animation and Illustration. But as I entered my sophomore year I became really interested in early Flash animation and started moving in a more interactive direction, changing my major to Computer Art with an emphasis in Interactive Design. I then made sure to draw in every interactive project I had, to keep that interest going as well. I&#8217;ve tried to keep that mindset ever since then, which has led me down the web design, illustration, graphic design and games path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-39556" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bo_3-660x407.jpg" alt="Image courtesy of Ryan Terry" width="660" height="407" /></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>What (if any) things did you do to transition yourself away from Flash when you saw the industry moving away from it?</b></strong></h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-39457" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/avatar92-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" />  <em>Question submitted by <strong>ButlerM</strong></em></p>
<p>The nail in the coffin for Flash was when Adobe said they’re not supporting it on mobile anymore. I know Actionscript, but Objective-C (X-Code) is a very different beast. I decided to start learning how to code apps, while simultaneously freelancing with app companies for front-end design jobs instead of doing both front-end and back-end jobs like I was doing before. I was designing apps immediately, so I’m very thankful for that work. I made my first app on my own within that year using only X-Code. I’m currently learning Unity since it’s cross-platform, powerful and the interface is nice for visual people like me. The biggest lesson I learned through this Flash transition is to always keep learning other software and mediums, keeping an eye on the future.</p>

<h2><strong><b>Can you share how you started in this field &amp; how challenging it was to get where you are right now? How did the opportunity to work at Disney open up?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar-02.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39523 size-full" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar-02.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Falcon</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a case of who you know. I have a friend who used to work at Disney and he was able to get me in touch with people who knew people in the department that I was trying to apply for. I also spent some time creating a customized version of my resume website just for Disney. It’s so important to do something special to stand out from the crowd when applying at Disney.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>When you tell people you work at Disney, what&#8217;s the first thing most people say?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39524" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-1.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>KaseyMoore</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Oh, cool. So do you work in Disneyland?”</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>Could you describe what your desk/office looks like?</b></strong></h2>
<p>I work in Disney’s Grand Central Creative Campus in Glendale, California. It’s a beauty!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-39547 size-large" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/7040751773_cd2f3f3359_b-660x356.jpg" alt="Disney’s Grand Central Creative Campus, Glendale, California" width="660" height="356" /></p>
<p>I work in an open office layout and I’m on the side of the office space by the windows.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-39548 size-full aligncenter" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DIS20551.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p>I have a desk that lets me stand, but I tend to work better sitting down. The best feature of my desk is my Cintiq. How did I live without this thing?! What a wonderful tool.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-39546 size-full aligncenter" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8nWmwctdssbOSolPcoS34J7TyekEdhsv8vDLy_X1R8g.jpeg" alt="Ryan Terry at work with his beloved Cintiq!" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>Out of all the different types of work at Disney, from web to mobile and from TV to film, what type of projects do you like to work on most of all, and what would you like to do more of?</b></strong></h2>
<p>I work specifically in the mobile market, making educational apps for kids. I’d be thrilled to work in the visual-development and character design roles for feature film or television.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>What percentage of your work is done by drawing by hand and what percentage is done using computers?</b></strong></h2>
<p>There’s a good amount of hand drawn work in pre-production when we’re brainstorming ideas and need to get rough visuals figured out. From there, I hand off my rough ideas to the rest of my INCREDIBLY talented art team and we work together to make something beautiful via computer.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong><b>What is your morning routine before you start designing?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39526" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>StyleWish</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coffee…coffee…and coffee.</p>

<h2><strong><b>Where do you get inspiration for your work?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39528" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-11.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Jollythemes</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All over the place! Thursdays are always fun because that’s when new apps are released in the App Store. I immediately download as many fun apps as I can find and play them for a few minutes. I also follow a lot of artist on Instagram and Twitter so I have a pretty constant feed of art throughout the day.</p>

<h2><strong><b>Which animator or illustrator has been most influential on your career, and why?</b></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Animator:</strong> Glen Keane — His work-ethic and skill is a never-ending inspiration to me.</p>
<p><strong>Illustrator:</strong> Al Hirschfeld — His simple line-work and wonderful caricatures always put a smile on my face.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>Share with us your top 3 favorite Disney or Pixar movies of all time, what are they, and what do you like most about them?</b></strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Incredibles</strong> — The scene where Dash is running on the water is the only time I’ve ever leapt out of my seat in applause during a movie.  Such a great sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Aladdin</strong> — I love the humor, the color and the animation</p>
<p><strong>The Lion King</strong> — The characters, the drama, the music.  How can anyone not love this one?</p>

<h2><strong><b>Having worked as both a freelancer and now at a huge company like Disney, which of the two methods of earning a living is the most challenging?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-6.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39530" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-6.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Patche</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest challenge with freelancing is not having a steady paycheck, but I was fortunate enough to always have work for the 8 years I freelanced. Working at a corporation has more challenges because you’re working with multiple lines of business and many more people than I worked with previously. Getting to work with so many incredibly talented artists and legends is something I could never do on my own otherwise. And I get to work with Mickey!</p>

<h2><strong><b>What are some important lessons that you have learnt along the way that you could give to authors on Envato Market?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-6.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39530" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-6.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Patche</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was actively selling templates on Envato I always tried to figure out how I could make a template based on current freelance work. Killing two birds with one stone. I wish I had spent more time purely working on templates as the residual income has been nice over the years and well worth the effort.</p>

<h2><strong><b>Sometimes, creative inspiration isn’t always easy to come by. What&#8217;s the best way to approach a blank page from your experience?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-1-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39532" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-1-11.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Matt Carrasco</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get outside! Do something to get out of your head. Take a walk. Or sometimes just scribbling nonsense lines on paper can make you see things in the lines that may inspire you. Read books, watch movies, go to dinner with friends. Also, sometimes you just need to lock yourself in a room and force yourself to throw as many ideas on paper as you can until something sticks. I love this quote by Jack London, &#8220;You can’t wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong><b>How do you balance your own style of illustration/animation with the distinct look and feel of new or established Disney characters? What freedom do you have to build-on/modify/enhance well-known Disney properties, and what challenges are involved with this?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar-03.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39535 size-full" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar-03.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>yashar1</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have strict style guides to make sure we stay true to the Disney aesthetic, but in the app Mickey’s Magical Math World we were able to have a lot of creative fun with the environment and space suits of Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, Donald and Goofy. We also created new alien and robot characters in the app.</p>

<hr />
<h2><strong><b>You’ve got a great idea for either a new character or an animation. What opportunities do you have at Disney to pitch new ideas?</b></strong></h2>
<p>Disney is open to all kinds of new ideas. They allow you to pitch to them for the opportunity to partner with you on it.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>Could you tell us about your graphic novel Zerbert? Where did the idea come from and how is it coming along?</b></strong></h2>

<p>Zerbert is a hobby of mine. I’m still working on the story so I don’t want to say too much yet. But I plan on being very transparent during the process on my Zerbert blog. Come join the fun at <a href="http://zerbertcomic.com">zerbertcomic.com</a>.</p>

<h2><strong><b>What would your advice be to someone who is very talented at what they do, but has not had a major break yet? Should their focus be on building a portfolio, creating their personal brand, perhaps pro-bono work, or something else?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39536" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-2.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Mustafa</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short answer; yes. Keep working and post your work everywhere you can; job sites, art forums, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. It’s important to have a clear, understandable website that gets right to the point. Think about what you’d want to see if you were hiring someone like yourself. And the best thing you can do is make something special for your future employer. Show them that you really want the gig and that you deserve it.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong><b>I have heard numerous professional &amp; academic suggestions saying that to get success from a creative career, one must focus entirely on one particular area. As a <em>jack of all trades</em> yourself, what is your response to this approach?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39538" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-3.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <strong>Mary Shinabarger </strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I could agree with this, but I can’t. I can easily say that the more varied your skills are, the more valuable you are to employers. The last 3 people I hired are able to do 3D, UI design and are incredible digital painters. This trend isn’t going away. The marketplace changes so quickly that you need people that can do multiple things. I’m certain that focusing on one trade will make you better at it, but you’d be surprised at how creative you can be in other disciplines.</p>

<h2><strong><b>Out of all of the currently active Disney animation productions, which one would be a dream project for you to work on?</b></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-4.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-39541" src="http://marketblog.envato.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/avatar92-4.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="50" /></a>  <em>Question submitted by <b>Mike McDonald</b></em></p>

<p>The Moana film looks stunningly beautiful. I’d love to be a part of that project.</p>

<h2><strong><b>Everybody seems to be forgetting the most important question: are you currently working on Star Wars?</b></strong></h2>

<p>Ha! I wish. Most of us at Disney are waiting with baited breath to see this one just like everyone else. It’ll be fantastic.</p>

<h2><strong><b>Phew! You made it, Ryan, awesome job! Could you tell us which was your favorite question and a little bit about the illustration you will be sending to the person who submitted the question?</b></strong></h2>
<p>My favorite question was from <strong>Butlerm: </strong><em>&#8220;Ryan, you seem to have a been a talented Flash animator when flash was still popular. What (if any) things did you do to transition yourself away from Flash when you saw the industry moving away from it?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Artwork I’m giving away:</strong></p>
<p>In light of Big Hero 6 winning an Oscar, I thought they might like to have the handful of original drawings I made of the characters.  Why give away one drawing when I can give away 6?!</p>
