You could, depending on what burner you had, manage to get an entire extra song on to a 80 minute CD. Nero would let you overburn into the lead-out area, where other programs wouldn&#39;t let you do this.

Basically malware at this point. And they just keep making it worse. Edit: good alternatives are **qBittorent**, **Deluge**, and **Transmission**. I have no experience with **qBittorent**, but many many people love it. **Transmission** is a very simple and easy torrent client, often described as &amp;quot;minimalist but not lacking&amp;quot;, that I currently use. I&#39;ve used **Deluge** in the past for more detailed sorting of torrent rss feeds, which is quite simple with the YaRSS plugin. Edit2: or [version 2.2.1](http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=8134) of **uTorrent**, the last good one. Thanks to /u/fuckfinally for the link. Edit 2b: try [this link](http://www.filehorse.com/download-utorrent/7858/) if your browser says the above one is corrupt. Thanks to /u/alkaline810. Edit 2c: /u/LatinGeek points out that outdated software can be vulnerable. Just a warning. Edit 3: /u/KjoeLjan provided me with [this link](http://libcom.org/forums/news/utorrent-bought-mpaa). Apparently uTorrent also has associations with the MPAA, which is pretty disheartening. Edit 4: another client that is flooding my inbox is **Tixati** . I cannot personally vouch for it but honestly anything is better than uTorrent. Edit 4b: getting reports that Vuze has gone downhill. Sorry guys. Edit 4c: **Tribler** and **BitComet** are being suggested as well. Edit 4d: **I&#39;m being told BitComet is a hated client and private trackers block it. No idea why but doesn&#39;t sound good. Also apparently Tribler has bad code. Again just what my inbox is being flooded with**. Edit 5: for mobile clients, I can only recommend [Flud](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delphicoder.flud) because that&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever used. I know, how lame, but I&#39;ve only torrented on mobile like 3 times. Edit 5b: apparently Torrex is good for WP users. Edit 6: just a friendly PSA, if you download content that could be construed as less than legal, I highly recommend you use a VPN that encrypts your traffic and **doesn&#39;t keep any logs**. [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com) is a pretty good provider with a lot of exit servers. [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) is also very anonymous, as they generate a random username for you and even accept cash in the mail as payment. Edit 6b: [Here&#39;s](http://torrentfreak.com/anonymous-vpn-service-provider-review-2015-150228/) a good resource regarding VPNs. Thanks /u/turkoid. Edit 7: I wouldn&#39;t use a torrent client with ads. There&#39;s just no need.</description></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp67x58</guid><title>StrawRedditor on Popular torrenting software µTorrent has included an automatic cryptocoin-miner in their latest update.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp67x58</link><dc:date>2015-03-06T13:45:36.988402+00:00</dc:date><description>I&#39;m surprised they did this actually.

And then of course there&#39;s really no reason to have done 2 and 3. They deliberately ran their software into the ground with shady practices that profit them and not the users. They used their fame to the disadvantage of their users. It&#39;s an all-around scummy thing to do. Edit: and now mining crypto-currencies on your machine without your consent.

That is exactly how you don&#39;t do customer service. When a customer says they are experiencing something you don&#39;t say, &amp;quot;well we tested that so you must be lying&amp;quot;, in so many words. And when multiple customers say the same thing and you still react that way, you have a big, big issue. Goodbye utorrent. ***Edit - I uninstalled uTorrent and it during the uninstall process it asked if I wanted to fill out an &amp;quot;uninstall survey&amp;quot;. I did, and made sure to include the reason why, being the inclusion of crypto-currency mining malware. I suggest you all do the same.***</description></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp67zwh</guid><title>hogger85 on Popular torrenting software µTorrent has included an automatic cryptocoin-miner in their latest update.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp67zwh</link><dc:date>2015-03-06T05:49:08.513498-08:00</dc:date><description>reminds me of an old anecdote we were told on customer care course.

The response from uTorrent: &amp;gt; Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We design our software to ensure that partner software downloads don&#39;t occur without approval by the user. But given your report, we’ve also double-checked this particular offer, and have determined that it cannot be installed without user approval. &amp;gt;Epic Scale is a cryptocurrency miner that uses a portion of your CPU cycles to contribute to the mining effort. A portion of the proceeds from this effort go to philanthropic initiatives. Please visit http://www.epicscale.com/ for more information. Epic Scale is a great partner for us to continue to generate revenue for the company, while contributing funds to good causes. In the future, Epic Scale plans to contribute CPU cycles to other initiatives, such as Genome mapping and other academic studies that require a great deal of processing power. &amp;gt;As Groundrunner stated, it&#39;s easy to uninstall the software via Add/Remove Programs. Per the Epic Scale CEO&#39;s response in comments on the link you shared, the only data left in ProgramData\Epicscale is a simple UUID (Unique User ID). This remains so that in case the software is reinstalled, BitTorrent would still be associated with the user. Feel free to delete this folder. You certainly won&#39;t see any persistent auto-reinstalls of the software, it will be gone from your machine for good.

Your CPU has a LOT of power saving features to basically run on a very low wattage when not in use. To do a quick calculation for cost of energy: KWatts * Hours * Cost of KWh = Total cost. Let&#39;s say on average your computer runs your CPU at say... Let&#39;s say 30 watts. Nothing amazing; it&#39;s probably higher. 0.03 KW * (24 * 30) * 0.1 C/KWh = 2.16$ a month just running your CPU. This is ridiculously low especially considering 30 watts is pretty nominal, you&#39;re probably looking at 50-70 watts average on a modern CPU but I choose 30 watts because it can drastically vary from CPU to CPU and laptops would run really low wattage, desktops higher. Anyway, if you run the calculation again and assuming your CPU has a max output at 100 watts, a bittorrent program might cause your computer to run at say 90 watts. That might only be 6.48$ in electricity BUT THAT&#39;S STILL MONEY YOU SHOULDN&#39;T OF HAD TO SPEND. It worse assuming if you have multiple computers and never shut them off. It&#39;s also worse if you assume they might even be using your GPU to do calculations(They probably aren&#39;t, to complicated/easy to see if they are) and GPUs use around 3 to 4 times the wattage of your CPU. This is VERY fucking horrible because they actually sell uTorrent. They might sell it for 10$(I dunno who buys uTorrent) so they can effectively charge you about 4$ a month without you knowing. Of course they might not get 4$ a month in selling the coins they get your computer to mine; but they still get a return by selling coins they mined.</description></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp696i3</guid><title>geoelectric on Popular torrenting software µTorrent has included an automatic cryptocoin-miner in their latest update.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp696i3</link><dc:date>2015-03-06T06:37:16.214524-08:00</dc:date><description>The last bit is one of the huge fuck yous about this.

Though to be fair if you can install a mining software on a million CPUs that aren&#39;t yours you can make a decent profit due to no cost for electricity on your part. Like uTorrent did. Though uTorrent would be pretty dumb to mine bitcoins on CPUs. It&#39;d probably be more profitable to mine Litecoin(Still doubt it) and even more profitable to have a person knowledgeable go on forums and mine the most hyped upcoming coin/early coin. If it blows up they make a killer profit, if it stays neutral they still make profit, if it tanks they lose nothing. Some coins for example within the fist week or more people can create huge and I mean huge amounts of generation. Mining works normally by giving more coins earlier and then decreasing with time. So within first month it may generate 1/3rd of all coins to be mined period. Then next 6 months generate another 1/3rd, then years to generate the last 1/3rd though it entirely depends. Since it goes by if you solve a block you get X reward in coins, if say the total hash rate is 5 K/Hash on the coin in question at the beginning, and you are giving it 2 k/Hash of the 5 k/Hash you&#39;re getting basically 1/8th of the total coins in the first month. Of course if it&#39;s popular it&#39;ll increase within first month, but in general some bigger names/smarter people who get in REALLY early(most profitable time) can make a huge amount of bank. A typical coin if it has any support is guaranteed to hit at least 100,000$, if you can sell it at 1 month in you made 10k. Some people wait and if coin fails it tanks from 100k to like 1k after a month, BUT if it gains popularity can increase to millions. So do you decide to sell at 100k? Or wait till 1 to 3 million with your 1/10th of the coins? I used to be into it pretty hard core; and actually made 36k off of mining, but it&#39;s just not really worth it. I sold my first batch early(Dogecoin) and hated myself because I got 16k for my coins could have got probably close to 100k or more. Then I got 3k here, 4k there and gave up after I got to far engrossed and never made profit for like 8 months at one point. Anyone who used to or still does mine dogecoin; I sold 100 million dogecoin for 16k. Even now that dogecoin is basically tanked 100 million is still 17K CAD where I live. At it&#39;s peak it would of been roughly 240 satoshi~(I sold roughly when it hit 40ish satoshi after the first initial drop from 100 satoshi to 40 before it skyrocketed. You live and learn, market is extremely volatile and it&#39;s hard to gauge what&#39;s going to be the next best thing really.</description></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp69ama</guid><title>borednerd on Popular torrenting software µTorrent has included an automatic cryptocoin-miner in their latest update.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp69ama</link><dc:date>2015-03-06T14:41:21.852997+00:00</dc:date><description>&amp;gt; SHOULDN&#39;T OF SHOULDN&#39;T HAVE</description></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp6882j</guid><title>WhyDidIMoveToHoth on Popular torrenting software µTorrent has included an automatic cryptocoin-miner in their latest update.</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2y4lar/popular_torrenting_software_µtorrent_has_included/cp6882j</link><dc:date>2015-03-06T13:59:12.674273+00:00</dc:date><description>I don&#39;t even get it.
